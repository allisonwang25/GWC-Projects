				<h2>What are reproductive rights?</h2>
				<p>Reproductive rights are legal rights and freedoms relating to reproduction and reproductive health. For women, this includes abortion-rights movements, birth control, education about STIs, right to menstrual health, protection from female genital mutilation among other things. </p>
				<p>I will mainly be focused on abortion rights and the recent changes regarding it in the US with the overruling of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. <em>Roe v. Wade</em> had, until Friday, June 24, protected women's rights to get an abortion in any state at least for the first trimester of the pregnancy. However, with its overruling, trigger laws in many states in the US have now prohibited abortions to varying levels, some even banning abortions for rape, incest, and ectopic pregnancies. </p>
				<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
				<p>Now, more than ever, women and others who need abortions need our support in their fight for their right to privacy and choice in regards to their bodies. And, with the kind of logic used to overrule <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, other rights protecting marginalized groups (e.g. LGBTQAI+ community) may also be overruled.</p>
