Even when the choices are not what you would choose. "+ experience+ " We cannot lose the critical protections afforded by the Roe v. Wade decision. Please do not let reproductive rights be rolled back where women lose autonomy over their own bodies. I'm asking you to protect our hard-earned progress and protect a womanâ€™s right to choose. All women must have access to safe and legal abortions and a woman's ability to make her own private health decisions should not be up for debate anymore."
