				<h2>Details of the Original <em>Roe v. Wade</em> Case</h2>
				<p><em>Roe v. Wade</em> was the case of Norma McCorvey, known by her legal pseudonym "Jane Roe". In 1969, she was having her third pregnancy and wanted to get an abortion, but Texas banned abortions unless it would save the mother's life. Her attorneys filed a lawsuit against her local district attorney, Henry Wade, alleging that the Texas abortion laws were unconstitutional. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled in her favor and the parties appealed this ruling to the Supreme Court. </p>
				<p>The Supreme Court issued a 7-2 decision on January 22, 1973, holding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides a fundamental "right to privacy", which protects a pregnant woman's rights to an abortion. The Court also held that the right to abortion wasn't absolute and must be balanced with the government's interests in protecting women's health and prenatal health. They balanced these two conflicting interests by declaring a pregnancy trimester timetable:</p>
				<ul id="trimester">
					<li>Trimester 1: Government cannot regulate abortion at all except in that it must be performed by a liscensed physician.</li>
					<li>Trimester 2: Government can regulate abortion only to protect maternal life and not to protect fetal life.</li>
					<li>Trimester 3/After Viability: Abortions can be regulated and even prohibited but only if exceptions are made for abortions necessary to save a mother's "life" or "health".</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This was a very controversial decision and some have called it judicial activism. Anti-abortion politicians and activists sought for decades to restrict abortion or overrule the decision but polls in the 21st century showed that a majority opposed overruling <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. Despite criticism, the Supreme Court upheld their ruling in <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em>, though they got overruled the trimester system and abandoned the "strict scrutiny" standard in favor of a more malleable "undue burden" test.</p>

				<h2>Overruling of <em>Roe v. Wade</em></h2>
				<p>On June 24, 2022, both <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em> were overruled by the landmark decision of <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization</em> in which the court held that the Constitution of the United States did not hold any right to abortion. The case was about the constitutionality of a Mississipi law that banned most abortion operations after the first 15 weeks of a pregnancy. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Mississipi's only abortion clinic, sued Thomas Dobbs, Mississipi's state health officer about this law. Lower courts had prevented the enforcement of this law because of preliminary injunctions which were based on the ruling of <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em> which prevented banning abortion before fetal viability.</p>
				<p>The ideological shift of the Supreme Court that intensified during the Trump administration and culminated with the 2020 appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett made it a possibility that <em>Roe v. Wade</em> would be overruled. Barrett was outspoken against abortion before her appointment, and social conservatives hoped she would overrule the precedent once on the court. Several states passed legislation, including trigger laws, to strictly regulate abortion should the newly conservative court overturn <em>Roe</em>. The Court ruled 6–3 to reverse the lower court rulings and a smaller majority of five justices joined the opinion overturning Roe and Casey. The majority opinion held that abortion was not a constitutional right and that individual states have the authority to regulate access to abortion rights. In the final opinion, it is stated that the reasoning used in the decision shouldn't be understood to apply against other modern rights, such as same-sex marriage, access to contraception or interracial marriage, stating that abortion is different since it refers to potential life. However, this statement shouldn't be taken at its word since  this particular group of conservative justices already are willing to overturn a major Supreme Court decision, and they laid out clear logic for overturning others in this realm.</p>
