				<h1 id="hi">about me!</h1>
		        <p id="description">Hi, I'm Allison! I'm 16 years old and a rising senior in the Bay Area and I use she/her pronouns.
				<br>
				 My favorite color is blue(specifically pastel blue)! Honestly, any color is better in pastel. I might 
				<br>
				grow out of that mindset though ahaha. I am a beginner coder, though I have the most basic knowledge 
				<br>
				about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Java. This website is a way for me to practice, so thank 
				<br>
				<strong>you</strong> for being here for it! I enjoy listening to and creating music (by creating I mean
				<br>
				playing music on the flute, piano, or singing) and it somewhat is my entire identity. Over quarantine, I
				<br>
				have taught myself how to crochet and can now make little miniature animals, though I've stopped since I 
				<br>
				ran out of stuffing! I spend way too much time these days watching anime, Twitch streamers, and YouTube
				<br>
				(mostly true crime and clipsters from streams at the moment), and I'm totally ok with it ;) I really want
				<br>
				to be a gamer(I've wanted to play Genshin and Valorant for the longest time), but as a Mac user, I have
				<br>
				resigned myself to mobile games, Nintendo Switch games, and watching streamers play. I hope I'll be able to
				<br>
				play someday! Thanks for reading all the way through :D Next is a little summary of the things I love!</p>
